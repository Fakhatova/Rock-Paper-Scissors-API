## About The Project

Rock-Paper-Scissors is an application where users can play game against computer. This app was designed as a way to simply interact with computer, by playing old but still popular game.  
The Rock-Paper-Scissors backend is built with a `Express.js` framework that stores new player credentials and game points. I did  expose this data to my frontend application to build out the user interface.

### Learning Goals

* Building a RESTful API with a Express.js
* Expose myself to backend API
* Able to write CRUD and execute
* Deploy API to Heroku
